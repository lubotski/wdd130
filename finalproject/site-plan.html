      <p>

      <h3>Consultancy Services</h3>
      <p>
        The second page of my website will be about consultancy services. With the growing population and infrastructure programs in the different areas in the Philippines, roads are getting smaller, worsening the traffic conditions in different cities in the country. Our company offers consultancy services that will ease the traffic problems in their localities. We partner with the local and national governments to help them manage the traffic situation.

      </ul>
      <h3>Training Services</h3>
      <p>
        Headlights is also offering training courses for traffic enforcers, local government officials, and city planning staff. Since these officials know the needs of their locality, we offer training programs to help them improve the traffic situation in their locality. Our lecturers will teach a wide range of topics, from software development, road safety, environmental impacts, and engineering aspects of transportation. We also offer lectures to grade school students to help make sure they are safe while walking on the streets.
