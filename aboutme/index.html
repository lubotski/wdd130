    <p>Hello everyone! It's so great to be in this class! I am from the Philippines. I am married with 2 children. My daughter is 18 and my son is 14 year old. I am currently working at the University of the Philippines,it is one of the state universities in the country. My family and I love to travel. We love nature. We enjoy the creations of our Father in Heaven.</p>
    <p>I've been interested in web design, that's why I enrolled in Applied Technology. I have seen my daughter work on a webpage for school, and I was so jealous that she could create a webpage. Like some of you, I am also a newbies in this course and I am looking forward to learn from all of you.</p>
